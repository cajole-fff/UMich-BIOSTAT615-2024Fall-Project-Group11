This package was created as a project for the course "BIOSTAT 615: Statistical Computing".
It provides an implementation of the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) clustering algorithm. 
It supports customizable parameters and efficient computation for clustering tasks. It also supports sparse matrix data structures using the 'Matrix' package in R 
to efficiently handle large, sparse datasets.
